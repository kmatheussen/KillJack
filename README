KILL JACK
=========


BACKGROUND
----------
The jack server sometimes crashes/freezes in a way that makes many users choose to restart the computer in order to restart jack.

You don't have to restart the computer, but googling the problem and finding a solution probably takes more time than doing a restart.

It's not very user friendly.


This goes for all platforms. It's not a bug in jack itself that causes these crashes/freezes, it's the way jack reacts when a client misbehave in certain ways.



ABOUT
-----
This program kills jack. Executables for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are provided. I strongly recommend that all programs using Jack includes a program like this.

Are you selling a $5000 DAW that uses Jack? No problem, you can include this program without asking me or giving me any credit. [1]
