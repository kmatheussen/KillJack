KILL JACK
=========


BACKGROUND
----------
The Jack server sometimes crashes/freezes in ways which make users restart the computer in order to use Jack again.

Users don't really have to restart the computer, but googling the problem and finding a solution could take more time than restarting.

This is not very user friendly.

The problem exists on all platforms. It's not a bug in Jack itself, it's how the program reacts when a client misbehave in certain ways.

A better solution to this problem than using this program, would be if Jack ran a watchdog, but it currently doesn't.



ABOUT
-----
This program kills Jack unconditionally. Executables for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are provided. I strongly recommend that all programs using Jack includes a program like this.

You are allowed to distribute this program any way you want. [1]
